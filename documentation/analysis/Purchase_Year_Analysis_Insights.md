## üéØ **Key Finding: Wait to Buy BEVs, Buy Diesel Now (If You Must)**

The analysis reveals a clear strategic insight: **the economic case for BEVs improves dramatically over time**, while diesel vehicles become increasingly expensive to operate.

## üìä **Average TCO Evolution Summary**

| Purchase Year | BEV Advantage | BEV TCO | Diesel TCO | Change from 2024 |
|---------------|---------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **2024** | **35.2%** | $213,354 | $329,040 | Baseline |
| **2026** | **36.9%** | $213,409 | $338,464 | +1.7% advantage |
| **2028** | **38.6%** | $213,658 | $348,179 | +3.4% advantage |
| **2030** | **40.2%** | $214,083 | $358,209 | +5.0% advantage |

### üîç **What This Means:**
- BEV TCO remains relatively stable (~$213k-214k)
- Diesel TCO increases by $29k over 6 years (+8.9%)
- **BEV advantage grows from 35% to 40%** - a 5 percentage point improvement

## üí∞ **BEV Price Reductions Drive Value**

### Technology Cost Savings (2024 vs 2030):

| Vehicle Model | 2024 Price | 2030 Price | Savings | % Reduction |
|---------------|------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Hyundai Mighty Electric** | $150,000 | $128,819 | $21,181 | **14.1%** |
| **Jac N75** | $176,500 | $151,578 | $24,922 | **14.1%** |
| **Jac N90** | $150,000 | $128,819 | $21,181 | **14.1%** |
| **Volvo FL** | $200,000 | $171,759 | $28,241 | **14.1%** |
| **MB eActros 300** | $400,000 | $343,518 | $56,482 | **14.1%** |

**Key Insight:** Battery cost reductions (7% annually) translate to 14% vehicle price reductions by 2030.

## üìà **The Mathematics Behind the Trends**

### Why BEV TCO Stays Stable:
1. **Lower purchase prices** (-14% by 2030) offset by:
2. **Higher electricity costs** over vehicle life (+2% annually)
3. **Technology efficiency gains** (-2% energy consumption annually)
4. **Net effect:** Roughly balanced TCO

### Why Diesel TCO Increases:
1. **Constant purchase prices** 
2. **Rapidly rising fuel costs** (+3% annually, major cost driver)
3. **Modest efficiency gains** (-1% consumption annually)
4. **Net effect:** Significant TCO increases

## üéØ **Strategic Recommendations**

### **For BEV Buyers:**
- **Later purchases are better** - every year you wait saves ~$21-56k in purchase price
- **TCO advantage improves by ~1% per year** 
- **Cost per km remains stable** at ~$0.62

### **For Diesel Buyers:**
- **Buy now if you must** - costs increase $4-5k per year delay
- **Consider accelerated replacement cycles** due to rising operating costs
- **Cost per km rises** from $0.95 to $1.04 (2024-2030)

### **Fleet Planning:**
- **Defer BEV purchases** where operationally feasible
- **Accelerate diesel replacement** programs
- **Model shows 5% additional advantage** by waiting 6 years

## üî¨ **Methodology Notes**

**Price Adjustments:**
- BEVs: 40% of price attributed to battery costs (declining 7% annually)
- Diesel: Constant pricing assumed

**Operating Cost Evolution:**
- All vehicles use adjusted fuel/energy price trajectories
- Technology improvements applied annually
- Maintenance cost escalation included

**Scenario Consistency:**
- Same 15-year ownership period for all purchase years
- Consistent financing terms (6% interest, 5-year term)
- Present value calculations at 5% discount rate

*The analysis demonstrates that under baseline assumptions, delaying BEV purchases and accelerating diesel replacement creates optimal economic outcomes for fleet operators.*
